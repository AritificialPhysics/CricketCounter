- An intuitive app for recording scores of two teams playing friendly cricket matches (also known as Gully Cricket). The team names, number of overs, and wickets are customizable in order to accomodate players who aren't playing the standard game and meet the app's expected target.  
- The app follows Material Design throughout, with everything from the layout to the color palette being in compliance with the guidelines.  
- The app has been designed in such a way, that even the most uninitated or new users should have no trouble in using it, as most of the interaction is done through buttons with clear labels.
